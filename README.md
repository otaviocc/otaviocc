### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm **OtÃ¡vio** (pronounced *O-TAH-vee-o*), a Physicist and Software Engineer hailing from Brazil ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· but now calling the United States ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ and Germany ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª my home for the past decade. My expertise lies in crafting software tailored for macOS and iOS, although I spent several years honing my skills in the realms of Linux and Embedded Systems.
